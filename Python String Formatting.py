# Python String Formatting
'''
F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of
formatting strings.
Before Python 3.6 we had to use the format() method.
F-Strings
F-string allows you to format selected parts of a string.
To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string
literal, like this:
Example
Create an f-string:

txt1 = format("The price is 49 dollars")
txt2 = f"The price is 50 dollars"
print(txt1)
print(txt2)

Placeholders and Modifiers
To format values in an f-string, add placeholders {}, a placeholder can
contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the
value.
Example
Add a placeholder for the price variable:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)

A placeholder can also include a modifier to format the value.
A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting
type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:
Example
Display the price with 2 decimals:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

You can also format a value directly without keeping it in a variable:
Example
Display the value 95 with 2 decimals:

txt = f"The price is {95:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

Perform Operations in F-Strings
You can perform Python operations inside the placeholders.
You can do math operations:
Example
Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result:

txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)

You can perform math operations on variables:
Example
Add taxes before displaying the price:

price = 50
tax = 0.06
txt = f"The price is {price + (price * tax)} dollars"
print(txt)

You can perform if...else statements inside the placeholders:
Example
Return "Expensive" if the price is over 50, otherwise return "Cheap":

price = 59 #change value 51 and try
txt = f"It is very {'Expensive' if price>50 else 'Cheap'}"
print(txt)

Execute Functions in F-Strings
You can execute functions inside the placeholder:
Example
Use the string method upper()to convert a value into upper case letters:

fruit = "apples"
txt = f"I love {fruit.upper()}"
print(txt)

The function does not have to be a built-in Python method, you can
create your own functions and use them:
Example
Create a function that converts feet into meters:

def myconverter(x):
    return x * 0.3048
txt = f"The plane is flying at a {myconverter(30000)} meter altitude"
print(txt)

More Modifiers
At the beginning of this chapter we explained how to use the .2f modifier
to format a number into a fixed point number with 2 decimals.
There are several other modifiers that can be used to format values:
Example
Use a comma as a thousand separator:

price = 1509000
txt = f"The price is {price:,} dollars"
print(txt)

String format()
Before Python 3.6 we used the format() method to format strings.
The format() method can still be used, but f-strings are faster and the
preferred way to format strings.
The next examples in this page demonstrates how to format strings with
the format() method.
The format() method also uses curly brackets as placeholders {}, but the
syntax is slightly different:
Example
Add a placeholder where you want to display the price:

price = 49
txt = "The price is {} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))

You can add parameters inside the curly brackets to specify how to
convert the value:
Example
Format the price to be displayed as a number with two decimals:

price = 49
txt = "The price is {:.2f} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))

Check out all formatting types in our String format() Reference.Multiple Values
If you want to use more values, just add more values to the format()
method:
print(txt.format(price, itemno, count))
And add more placeholders:
Example

quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item number {} for {:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

Index Numbers
You can use index numbers (a number inside the curly brackets {0}) to
be sure the values are placed in the correct placeholders:
Example

quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {1} pieces of item number {0} for {2:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

Also, if you want to refer to the same value more than once, use the
index number:
Example

age = 36
name = "John"
txt = "His name is {1}. {1} is {0} years old."
print(txt.format(age, name))

Named Indexes
You can also use named indexes by entering a name inside the curly
brackets {carname}, but then you must use names when you pass the
parameter values txt.format(carname = "Ford"):
Example
'''
myorder = "I have a {carname}, it is a {model}."
print(myorder.format(carname = "Ford", model = "Mustang"))
