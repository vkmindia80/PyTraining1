#Python Dictionaries
'''Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow
duplicates.
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier,
dictionaries are unordered.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
Example
Create and print a dictionary:
# Using curly braces {}

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Dictionary Items
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by
using the key name.

Example
Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford","model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])
print(thisdict["model"])
print(thisdict["year"])

Ordered or Unordered?
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier,
dictionaries are unordered.
When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a
defined order, and that order will not change.
Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot
refer to an item by using an index.

Changeable
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove
items after the dictionary has been created.
Duplicates Not Allowed
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
Example
Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964,
"year": 2020}
print(thisdict)
print(thisdict["brand"])
print(thisdict["model"])
print(thisdict["year"])

Dictionary Length
To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
Example
Print the number of items in the dictionary:

print(len(thisdict))

Dictionary Items - Data Types
The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
Example
String, int, boolean, and list data types:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"electric": False,
"year": 1964,
"colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
print(thisdict)
print(thisdict["brand"])
print(thisdict["electric"])
print(thisdict["year"])
print(thisdict["colors"])
print(len(thisdict))

type()From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data
type 'dict':
<class 'dict'>
Example
Print the data type of a dictionary:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))
print(type(thisdict["brand"]))
print(type(thisdict["model"]))
print(type(thisdict["year"]))

Access Dictionary Items
Accessing Items
You can access/read the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name,
inside square brackets:
Example
Get the value of the "model" key:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["brand"]
print(x)
There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
Example
Get the value of the "model" key:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.get("model")
print(x)

Get Keys
The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
Example
Get a list of the keys:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.keys()
print(x)

The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes
done to the dictionary will be reflected in the keys list.
Example
Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets
updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "white"
print(x) #after the change

Get Values
The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
Example
Get a list of the values:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.keys()
print(x)
y = thisdict.values()
print(y)

The list of the values is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes
done to the dictionary will be reflected in the values list.
Example
Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets
updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["year"] = 2020
print(x) #after the change

Example
Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets
updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change

Get Items
The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
Example
Get a list of the key:value pairs

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x)

The returned list is a view of the items of the dictionary, meaning that any
changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the items list.
Example
Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets
updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["year"] = 2020
print(x) #after the change

Example
Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets
updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change

Check if Key Exists
To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:
Example
Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964}
if "model" in thisdict:
    print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

Change Dictionary Items
Change Values
You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
Example
Change the "year" to 2018:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018
print(thisdict)

Update Dictionary
The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given
argument.
The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value
pairs.
ExampleUpdate the "year" of the car by using the update() method:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})
print(thisdict)

Add Dictionary Items
Adding Items
Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and
assigning a value to it:
Example

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

Update DictionaryThe update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given
argument. If the item does not exist, the item will be added.
The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value
pairs.
Example
Add a color item to the dictionary by using the update() method:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"color": "red"})
print(thisdict)

Remove Dictionary Items
Removing Items
There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:
Example
The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

Example
The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7,
a random item is removed instead):

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

Example
The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

Example
The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang","year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.

Example
The clear() method empties the dictionary:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)

Loop Dictionaries
Loop Through a Dictionary
You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.
When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the
dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.
Example
Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
# Example: Print all keys in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
    print(x)
# Example: Print all keys in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict.keys():
    print(x)
# Example: Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
    print(thisdict[x])
# Example: Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict.values():
    print(x)
# Example: Print all keys and values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
    print(x, thisdict[x])
# Example: Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
    print(x, y)

Copy Dictionaries
Copy a Dictionary
You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1,
because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made
in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary
method copy().
Example
Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
print(thisdict)

Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().
Example
Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:

thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

Nested Dictionaries
A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.
Example
Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:

myfamily = {
"child1" : {
"name" : "Emil",
"year" : 2004
},
"child2" : {
"name" : "Tobias",
"year" : 2007},
"child3" : {
"name" : "Linus",
"year" : 2011
}
}
print(myfamily)

Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary:
Example
Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the
other three dictionaries:

child1 = {
"name" : "Emil",
"year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
"name" : "Tobias",
"year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
"name" : "Linus",
"year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
"child1" : child1,
"child2" : child2,
"child3" : child3
}
print(myfamily)

Practice Examples:
Dictionary.py
#1. Creating a Dictionary:
# Using curly braces {}
# creating a dictionary
country_capitals = {
"Germany": "Berlin",
"Canada": "Ottawa",
"England": "London"
}
# printing the dictionary
print(country_capitals)
#o/p: {'Germany': 'Berlin', 'Canada': 'Ottawa', 'England': 'London'}
Example2:
thisdict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(thisdict)
# Using the dict() constructor
another_dict = dict(brand="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1964)
print(another_dict)
#2. Accessing Dictionary Elements:
# access the value of keys
print(country_capitals["Germany"]) # Output: Berlin
print(country_capitals["England"]) # Output: London
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
# Accessing value by key
print(my_dict["name"])
# Using the get() method (safer, returns None if key not found)
print(my_dict.get("age"))
print(my_dict.get("country")) # Returns None#3. Modifying Dictionary Elements:
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
# Changing an existing value
my_dict["age"] = 31
print(my_dict)
# Adding a new key-value pair
my_dict["occupation"] = "Engineer"
print(my_dict)
# ex2 - add an item with "Italy" as key and "Rome" as its value
country_capitals["Italy"] = "Rome"
print(country_capitals)
# Using update() to add/modify multiple items
my_dict.update({"city": "London", "age": 32})
print(my_dict)
#4. Removing Dictionary Elements:
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
# Using del to remove a specific key-value pair
del my_dict["city"]
print(my_dict)
# Using pop() to remove and retrieve a value
removed_age = my_dict.pop("age")
print(my_dict)
print(f"Removed age: {removed_age}")
# Using clear() to remove all items
my_dict.clear()
print(my_dict)
#Ex2 delete item having "Germany" key
del country_capitals["Germany"]
print(country_capitals)
# clear the dictionary(remove all items )
country_capitals.clear()
print(country_capitals)
#5. Iterating Through a Dictionary:
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}# Iterating through keys
for key in my_dict:
print(key)
# Iterating through values
for value in my_dict.values():
print(value)
# Iterating through key-value pairs
for key, value in my_dict.items():
print(f"{key}: {value}")
# change the value of "Italy" key to "Rome"
country_capitals["Italy"] = "Naples"
print(country_capitals)
# Ex2 -- print dictionary keys one by one
country_capitals = {
"United States": "Washington D.C.",
"Italy": "Rome"
}
# print dictionary keys one by one
for country in country_capitals:
print(country)
print()
# print dictionary values one by one
for country in country_capitals:
capital = country_capitals[country]
print(capital)
# print dictionary length
numbers = {10: "ten", 20: "twenty", 30: "thirty"}
# get dictionary's length
print(len(numbers)) # Output
