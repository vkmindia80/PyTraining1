Python Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties
from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
Create a Parent Class
Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other
class:
Example
Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and
a printname method:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

Create a Child Class
To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent
class as a parameter when creating the child class:
Example
Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from
the Person class:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):
    pass
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

Note: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or
methods to the class.
Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person class.
Example
Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):pass
y = Student("Ryan", "Warner")
y.printname()

Add the __init__() Function
So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from
its parent.
We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of
the pass keyword).
Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being
used to create a new object.
Example
Add the __init__() function to the Student class:

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
#add properties etc.
# When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.
# Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.
# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
x = Student("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, and kept the inheritance
of the parent class, and we are ready to add functionality in
the __init__() function.
Use the super() Function
Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the
methods and properties from its parent:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
x = Student("James", "Gerber")
x.printname()

By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent
element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.Add Properties to Child class
Example
Add a property called graduationyear to the Student class:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = 2019
x = Student("Andy", "Moore")
x.printname()
print(x.graduationyear)

In the example below, the year 2019 should be a variable, and passed into
the Student class when creating student objects. To do so, add another parameter
in the __init__() function:
Example
Add a year parameter, and pass the correct year when creating objects:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = year
x = Student("Lindsey", "Jacob", 2022)
x.printname() 
print(x.graduationyear)

Add Methods to Child class
Example
Add a method called welcome to the Student class:
'''
class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = year
    def welcome(self):
        print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)
x = Student("Huan", "Kim", 2024)
x.welcome()
